Interviews are stressful by design in preparing for it, in waiting to be interviewed, and within the interview itself and it gets more and more when you get asked about new things that you never knew or heard about before the interview. I remember my first interview, I attended without preparing anything, I was almost 1 year of experience and thought that I knew everything. I was rejected and believe me, it was a turning point in my life.

Hi, I‚Äôm Zak, Android Lead @ [Instabug](https://instabug.com) with almost 10+ years in the field, started with no CS background and I‚Äôll be sharing my learnings over the past years.

## Before the interview üí°
You should always prepare for interviews and if you don‚Äôt have time to prepare, postpone it. You should always be focused and prepared if you want to get accepted.

### Reading vs Learning
For Android, I always start by searching online for interview questions, books, glass-door answers‚Ä¶etc there are tons of questions and answers that you should learn, know & understand. Reading some questions and answers will not make a good engineer from you.

For me, when I was invited to interview @ 
Instabug
 I searched about the company, their technology, downloaded the SDK, & started to read their docs and understand how their features work, and I noticed that I should prepare myself well about Java Basics, Memory Management, Threading & Android architecture.

After all of these, I noticed that there is something important that I didn‚Äôt know about and it was testing so I started to cover the task with both unit-testing and UI Testing, and believe me it was harder than writing the task itself however I learned a lot from it.

> Learn, Learn & Learn. Don‚Äôt copy/paste, Good engineers always learn, so if there is a new keyword or answer that you don‚Äôt understand, you should understand and learn it.

### Problem Solving
Most of the interviews contain problem-solving, some of them may be android related challenges, like designing a chatting app, shopping cart, how Uber app work, etc and other may ask about real problem solving or pair programming. So my advice here will be to solve some online problems from Codility, Hackerrank, etc, and reading Cracking coding interview book.

### Code Reviews
Some companies may give you some snippets to review, they will be testing your code review skills, so you need to be focused and your eyes should catch errors like naming conventions, threading issues, leaks, code structure‚Ä¶etc

### Know your Employer & Interviewers
You should study the company that you are applying for, their technology stack, app, SDK, check the features they have, and think how it is implemented as you may be asked about a solution to a challenge they faced.

You should also know who will interview you and you may reach out to them and ask about the interview. Familiarity will help a lot in keeping you less stressed. Check what is he/she interested in you may find something common.

### Stay Updated
You should always be aware of the new things in the Tech world, Latest android version features, Google I/O, events, libraries, tools, talks, etc. All these things will make your mind so open to new things.

## The Interview ü§µ
The day before the interview sleep well and wake up after good sleeping hours, dress according to the invitation request(formal/casual) and be focused, calm and smile üòä

* Don‚Äôt panic, keep calm, you should be smart and understand that it is a cool challenge and you will learn a lot from it.
* Present yourself well and mention all the achievements you did in your career if you are 1+ years of experience when you are asked to speak about your career path.
* Listen to the questions well and make sure you understand it.
* Don‚Äôt answer quickly and think well before answering.
* If you do not know the answer to a question say I don‚Äôt know, it is a good idea to tell the interviewer that you can think about an answer that might be right or wrong.
* If there is a problem you don‚Äôt know its answer Please Think hard about a solution as this is the main purpose of the problem to let the interviewer know how your mind works. *Don‚Äôt Give up.*
* Write down / remember the questions that you can‚Äôt answer (Personally I use a note-taking app or a small notebook)
> Any Interview is a win-win situation, You should always learn about your weakest skills and develop them.

At the end of the interview thank the interviewer(s) for their time and ask any further information that you need to know about the company, like their process, technology, or anything that you need to know. You can also ask for feedback and you can also give feedback if you were asked.

After Interview üè†
Start preparing for the next interview, don‚Äôt wait for the reply.
If you do not receive a reply after the expected timeframe, follow up if the position is still available.
If there is not a positive reply in your email, reply saying it was a pleasure and you wish to work with the company. Looking forward to new opportunities.
Interviews are like challenges you might win or lose, but in both cases you will learn, so Keep your hopes high and never give up.

Do you think this is enough?! How do you get prepared for interviews? share with me your thoughts.
